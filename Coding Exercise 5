'''

Be sure to use functions as the starting program does.
Ask for player's name. Output their name at least once.
Ask player if they would like to play an EASY, MEDIUM or HARD game.
easy = range of 1 to 10, limit tries to 5.
medium = range of 1 to 100, limit tries to 8.
hard = range of 1 to 1000, limit tries to 10.
If the player doesn't guess the number in the required amount of tries, they lose the game.
Keep track of the wins and loses for the player, displaying the score before asking if they would like to play again.
Be sure to create a comment at the top of the program with your name, the date, and the class number, and assignment name.
Include comments to describe what you are doing in your program. Refer to your textbook code examples for an appropriate level of comments.
